### Change 1

There are some places where you exceed the maximum line length. 

### Change 2

Since you created a new quality feature, it is important to include the count distribution of the new feature in the univariate section.

### Change 3

For the univariate section, please consider expanding the discussion about the outliers for each feature. You can even remove outliers if you find it appropriate, that will make the following analysis more robust.

### Change 4

Optional, For the quality rating, since this is a categorical feature, a bar plot is more appropriate to depict the count distribution. A histogram is optimal to depict the distribution of continuous features. 

### Change 5

For the multivariate scatter plot, please avoid from including more than 3 feature on a single chart.

### Change 6

When one of the features is categorical, you should code the categorical feature with the color. (Quality)

### Change 7

The chart here bellow is overplotted, please consider my comment above about alternatives. (Regression plot)

### Change 8

Final plot 3 appear only in the final plot section.

For final plot 3, please include only 3 feature on a single figure to reduce the overplotting and make the figure easier to interpret.
